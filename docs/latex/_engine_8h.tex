\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Unified include file for all core engine modules. 

Aggregates commonly used engine headers into a single location for convenience. This is intended for source files (.cpp) that require broad access to engine features, including subsystems such as rendering, input, game state, and math utilities.

Recommended for use in application entry points, game state files, or quick prototypes. Avoid including this in header files to prevent unnecessary coupling and compilation overhead.
